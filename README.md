The objective of the project was to comunnicate 2 computers with COM port. Sending and receiving messages correctly using the low levels of RM-OSI model, this means using correctly all kind of control code. We will end using a master-slave patern.


The first practical sessions of the subject have as their objective the familiarization with an RS-232 port control library. Most current general-purpose operating systems include drivers for the serial ports available on the computer. To avoid embedding access instructions directly to the hardware, the SerialPort library is provided that makes use of the Windows.h library. With it, an application will be built that allows precise control of all the circuits of an RS-232C port.
